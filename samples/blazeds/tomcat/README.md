# Feathers UI RPC with BlazeDS and Tomcat

The [blazeds-turnkey-archive](https://github.com/joshtynjala/blazeds-turnkey-archive) repository contains a _turnkey_ bundle originally published by Adobe. It includes sample apps that demonstrate how to use BlazeDS/Tomcat on the server with Adobe Flex SDK apps on the client. See the instructions to learn how to upgrade Tomcat and BlazeDS.

The [feathersui-blazeds-turnkey-samples](https://github.com/feathersui/feathersui-blazeds-turnkey-samples) repository contains replacement frontend samples for the BlazeDS Turnkey bundle that have been rewritten with Feathers UI and Haxe. See the instructions for each sample to learn where to place the compiled output.
